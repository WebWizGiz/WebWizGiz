### Hello, I'm Gizem ðŸ¤–

After 8 years as an engineer specializing in quality systems, process improvement and digital transformation, I decided to take my career in a new direction. 
My drive to solve complex problems led me into the world of software development, where I dedicated myself to mastering backend technologies.

Now, with a solid foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and Cloud Technologies, Iâ€™m ready to build efficient and impactful solutions.
